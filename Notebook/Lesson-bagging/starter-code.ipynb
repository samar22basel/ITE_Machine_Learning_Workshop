    "## Introduction to Ensemble Methods\n",
    "We can list out the different types of models we've built thus far:\n",
    "- Linear Regression\n",
    "- Logistic Regression\n",
    "- $k$-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "- Naive Bayes Classification \n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to use any of these models, we follow the same type of process.\n",
    "1. Based on our problem, we identify which model to use. (Is our problem classification or regression? Do we want an interpretable model?)\n",
    "2. Fit the model using the training data.\n",
    "3. Use the fit model to generate predictions.\n",
    "4. Evaluate our model's performance and, if necessary, return to step 2 and make changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we've always had exactly one model. Today, however, we're going to talk about **ensemble methods**. Mentally, you should think about this as if we build multiple models and then aggregate their results in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why would we build an \"ensemble model?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to estimate $f$, the true function. (Think about $f$ as the **true process** that dictates Ames housing prices.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We can come up with different models $m_1$, $m_2$, and so on to get as close to $f$ as possible. (Think about $m_1$ as the model you built to predict $f$, think of $m_2$ as the model your neighbor built to predict $f$, and so on.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### (BONUS) Three Benefits: Statistical, Computational, Representational\n",
    "- The **statistical** benefit to ensemble methods: By building one model, our predictions are almost certainly going to be wrong. Predictions from one model might overestimate housing prices; predictions from another model might underestimate housing prices. By \"averaging\" predictions from multiple models, we'll see that we can often cancel our errors out and get closer to the true function $f$.\n",
    "- The **computational** benefit to ensemble methods: It might be impossible to develop one model that globally optimizes our objective function. (Remember that CART reach locally-optimal solutions that aren't guaranteed to be the globally-optimal solution.) In these cases, it may be **impossible** for one CART to arrive at the true function $f$. However, generating many different models and averaging their predictions may allow us to get results that are closer to the global optimum than any individual model.\n",
    "- The **representational** benefit to ensemble methods: Even if we had all the data and all the computer power in the world, it might be impossible for one model to **exactly** equal $f$. For example, a linear regression model can never model a relationship where a one-unit change in $X$ is associated with some *different* change in $Y$ based on the value of $X$. All models have some shortcomings. (See [the no free lunch theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_in_search_and_optimization).) While individual models have shortcomings, by creating multiple models and aggregating their predictions, we can actually create predictions that represent something that one model cannot ever represent.\n",

    "## Bagging: Bootstrap Aggregating\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are powerful machine learning models. However, decision trees have some limitations. In particular, trees that are grown very deep tend to learn highly irregular patterns (a.k.a. they overfit their training sets). \n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging (bootstrap aggregating) mitigates this problem by exposing different trees to different sub-samples of the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process for creating bagged decision trees is as follows:\n",
    "1. From the original data of size $n$, bootstrap $B$ samples each of size $n$ (with replacement!).\n",
    "2. Build a decision tree on each bootstrapped sample.\n",
    "3. Make predictions by passing a test observation through all $B$ trees and developing one aggregate prediction for that observation.\n",
